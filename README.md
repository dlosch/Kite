# Diploma thesis (parts of, ca. 2003) :)

I just found (parts of) the code from my diploma thesis from ca. 20 years ago:D

**I had never written any meaningful C++, COM, ATL, DirectShow filter, or Winsock code before**. Didn't know about apartment states (which probably make you [sound like a crazy person](https://x.com/jaredpar/status/1569840321760206849). This was the result. 

*Even though I have no idea whether the result was or is considered ok by seasoned experts in said areas, I am still super proud of the result. I started from absolute zero, got up to speed with everything and still tried to produce neat solutions along the way. Probably (unfortunately) still to this day my most challenging project. Seeing a C++ app doing audio and video streaming processing megabytes of data with a varienty other clients without crashing or memory hogging for hours. Sweet.* Even integrated some existing codecs from ffmpeg into the solution. The app was written in C#.

Also, the department of the university where I wrote this was linux only, so no one could help me:)
